                decimals: 3
                decimalPoint: '.'
                thousandsSeparator: ','
                zeroIsEmpty: TRUE
                emptyValue: '-'
                zeroClear: TRUE
                mask: '1U'
                showUnit: FALSE 
                nbsp: TRUE
                unit: Kƒç
                intOnly: -1 # -1 is default value
                
            usd:
                unit: '$'
            gbp: [] # use default format 
    
    session: [FALSE] # save info about currencies to session, default is only to cookie
    vat: [0] # add number like percent, example: 21
    strict: [FALSE] # default enabled, download only defined currencies, example: ['CZK', 'EUR']
    defaultFormat: [NULL] # how format currency if format is not defined, value is array like above "currencies.czk" 
    managerParameter: [currency] # is parameter for query, cookie and session if is available
